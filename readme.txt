Hello! Welcome to the thing!

Looks like I spent quite a bit of time on this!
I had a few interruptions in the meantime, but I still
feel like I ran a bit long.

That being said:
Here it is! Thank god for that google chrome responsive
inspection tool. Definitely helps. 

Couple of things:
I didn't incorporate the animation of the pledge bars. The way
I built the javascript inside the body of the page, I tried several
different ways but I don't know if it's possible to finagle
a transition of the bars through an innerHTML declaration. There's
likely a better way to do that. My vanilla javascript isn't quite
as up to snuff as I thought.

I did three sizes for responsive design, but I didn't incorporate
portrait and landscape. That definitely isn't ideal.

That being said, I'm sure there are other things that aren't
your favorite things to see on an assessment! But to be honest,
I learned a lot and I had a lot of fun doing it! Whatever
happens I want to thank you for the opportunity and you have a 
wonderful day!

EDIT: It was driving me crazy over the weekend so I made a branch called revision-with-better-stuff and made a few changes here and there. The master is still the one I did for the assessment. I just made that one to keep me sane but if you wanted to look at it I wouldn't mind.
